    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

    <p>Bits & Pips ("we," "our," or "us") operates the EchoLAN mobile and desktop application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Application.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Summary: No Server, No Tracking</h3>
        <p>EchoLAN is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) application designed for Local Area Networks (LAN). We do not operate a central server that stores your messages, files, or video calls. All communication happens directly between devices on your local network. <strong>We do not collect, store, or sell your personal data.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Permissions</h2>
    <p>To function correctly, EchoLAN requires access to specific features on your device. This data is processed locally and is never sent to Bits & Pips or third parties.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Network Usage:</strong> Required to discover other devices on your Wi-Fi or LAN to facilitate chat and file transfers.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera & Microphone:</strong> Required only when you initiate video calls, voice calls, or capture photos/videos within the app. This data is streamed directly to the peer you are calling and is not recorded by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage / Photos / Files:</strong> Required to save files you download from peers or to select files you wish to share.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since we do not run a central server, we do not retain your data. Chat history and files are stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the application, this data is permanently removed from your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The application does not use third-party tracking services (like Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel) to track your behavior.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust. While EchoLAN operates on your local network, we recommend using a secure WPA2/WPA3 Wi-Fi password to prevent unauthorized users from joining your LAN and seeing your devices.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
